# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about everything related to web technologies, I mean you need to learn alot of stuff, so instead
of focusing on every new technology out there and learning every new cool everyone else is using, why not focus more on the core 
development skills, like learning the underlying technologies instead, improving your concepts and understand the ins and outs of how
things work on the web, that way you will be in a better position to learn anything new coming your way, because you will be able to 
understand what's going on under the hood which will make it way more easier for you to grasp it.
